Feature: Data Tables In Cucumber
  The data tables in cucumber allows you to pass as a parameter to a single step a more complex data structure
  There are multiple cases that we do not want to run our scenario with Outline multiple times,
  Instead we need to pass a List, or a Map at once to the Step
  This is done for:
  - Filling out a form
  - Passing expected values that we need to verify (Tabs)

  Here are fe examples of what data can be converted to:
  - List
  - Map
  - List<List>
  - List<Maps>
  - Custom data

  # Cucumber has a synonym for Scenario that is Example
  # Example === Scenario
